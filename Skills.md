------------ |  ------------ | ------------ | ------------ |

#### Acrobatics (Special)
> The ability to perform tumbles, somersaults and other complex maneuvers. This skill teaches balance, flexibility and speed. Use Acrobatics and Dexterity for most Tasks. This skill is commonly known by circus performers, dancers, martial artists, gymnasts, and athletes. Also, Acrobatics can be used instead of the Dodge Skill to avoid attacks.

#### Acting
>The ability to play a role and successfully counterfeit behaviors, emotions and other character traits. A talented actor can weep on demand, or convincingly display an array of emotions. This skill is useful to both legitimate artists and criminals and con men. Use Intelligence and Acting to give a good performance, and Perception and Acting to spot or judge someone else’s act.

#### Beautician
>This is the ability to use make-up, hair dressing, and cosmetics to enhance a person’s appearance. Use Intelligence and Beautician for the Task; each Success Level adds a +1 to a person’s Attractiveness by hiding blemishes and enhancing a person’s good points. Modifiers to these Tasks include the materials available (a +2 in a fully stocked beauty salon, -2 or worse with improvised materials) and the subject’s basic Attractiveness level.

>Beautician Skills can also be used to help change a person’s appearance (Beautician and Intelligence). A skilled character can use hair dyes, contacts and make-up to change a person’s look greatly. This skill can be used to replace the Disguise Skill, or can add a +1 bonus to Disguise Tasks for each level of success in the Beautician and Intelligence Task.

>Using Beautician and Perception allows the character to see how extensively a person is made up, and may be used to identify a disguise (this Task is resisted by the disguiser’s own Intelligence and Beautician or Disguise Skills).

#### Brawling
>Brawling covers basic street fighting, karate-parlor “martial arts” training, and similar combat skills. In hand-to-hand combat, Dexterity and Brawling are used for kicks, punches, and similar maneuvers. Strength and Brawling are used for take-downs, wrestling and slamming people around.

#### Bureaucracy
>This skill provides familiarity with the organization of, and procedures used by, bureaucratic institutions. With this skill, the character can find ways to improve an organization’s service and performance, or otherwise obtain their services or products more efficiently. Use Intelligence and Bureaucracy to devise ways to make a large group or organization more (or less) efficient; use Willpower and Bureaucracy to “cut through red tape.”

#### Cheating
>The skill of breaking the rules and tricking an opponent. Mostly used in games of chance and other forms of gambling. Use Intelligence and Cheating to perform the trick, or Perception and Cheating to spot such a trick.

#### Climbing
>A character with the Climbing Skill knows how to best use any surface to get to the top. Climbing Tasks use Dexterity, Strength or Constitution, depending on the type of climb attempted.

#### Computer Hacking
>This is the skill to penetrate computer systems through a modem, overcome protection and password programs, and steal information or inflict damage on the system. Most tasks use Intelligence and Computer Hacking, although spotting a specific type of defense or password system may use Perception and Computer Hacking instead.

#### Computer Programming
>The skill to write a set of commands in one of the many computer languages. Writing a program uses Intelligence and Computer Programming; Perception and Computer Programming is used to recognize elements of another program.
