------------ |  ------------ | ------------ | ------------ |

#### Acute/Impaired Senses
##### 2-point Physical Quality or Drawback
>This Quality/Drawback must be purchased separately for each sense: sight, hearing, touch, smell or taste. Normally, the five senses are represented by the Perception Attribute. Acute or Impaired senses indicate one or more senses that are higher or lower than normal for a person with that Perception Attribute.

>When bought as a Quality, an Acute Sense gives the character a +3 bonus to any Perception-related Test or Task that relies on that sense. If acquired as a Drawback, an Impaired Sense gives a similar -3 penalty to Perception-based Tests or Tasks.

>Some Impaired Senses (hearing and sight in particular) can be easily corrected in the modern age through the use of glasses, hearing aids and similar devices. If the impairment is eliminated by the use of such devices, the Zombie Master should reduce the value of the Drawback to 1 point. It is possible to have more than one type of Acute or Impaired Sense, or, for example, to have Acute Hearing and Impaired Eyesight, or a similar combination of senses. For obvious reasons, a character cannot select both the Impaired and Acute versions of the same sense.

#### Addiction
##### Variable Mental Drawback
>An addict craves a substance and must have it, even against his better judgement. Most addictive substances eventually impact on his health. Many of them are also illegal, and using or purchasing them may land the character in jail should he be discovered. Those concerns matter little to the addict, however; when the craving hits, he can rarely resist it. He often does things he would normally never consider in order to satisfy his need, from cheating and stealing to committing serious crimes to selling his body or even betraying his friends.

>When an addicted character hasn’t gotten his usual “fix,” he suffers from debilitating withdrawal symptoms. Most mental actions (e.g., any Tasks or Tests using Intelligence, Perception or Willpower) are at a penalty equal to the value of the Drawback (so, a character with a 2-point Addiction suffers a -2 penalty to most mental actions) until the addict can get what he needs. The most severe drugs (like heroin) also produce strong physical effects; such addicts have a penalty of -3 to all physical actions in addition to the above penalty on mental actions.

>The value of this Drawback is determined by the severity of the addiction and the relative effects of the drug or substance. A detailed description of the effects of different addictive substances would fill an entire book or more. Chroniclers should adjudicate the game effects of a “high” on a character. This can range from a small action penalty for being slightly “buzzed,” to the complete stupor of a heroin trip. In the game, as in real life, drugs are dangerous and unpredictable, and an addict character is often unable to control himself.

>The Addiction Point Value Table gives guidelines for the value of a given type of addiction. Zombie Masters should modify these values as desired.

Addiction: | Point Value: |
------------ |  ------------ |
**Habitual drinking or smoking:** | 1 point |
**Heavy drinking or smoking, light use of marijuana or LSD:** | 2 points |
**Heavy use of marijuana or LSD:** | 3 points |
**Alcoholism, habitual use of barbiturates or cocaine:** | 4 points |
**Habitual use of heroin, heavy use of barbiturates or cocaine:** | 5 points |
**Heavy use of heroin:** | 6 points |
