## The Forest; In a Rulebook

 [Charecter Creation]() | [Qualities and Drawbacks]() | [Skills]() | [Weopons]() |
------------ |  ------------ | ------------ | ------------ |

#### Primary Attributes
#### Secondary Atributes
#### Norm Stats
#### Survivor Stats
#### Qualities
#### Drawbacks


This Rulebook is by no means done, I am in the process of writting things and all that jazz. We are keeping stuff mostly the same with some new stuff. Foe now I'm just putting the utility of many of the many Drawbacks and Qualities, the flavor will be added later

Love,
Papa
